What is Email Marketing?
-----------------------------

The definition of email marketing is simple and self-explanatory. It is about marketing that is done through an electronic mail.


But, to be more specific, email marketing means targeting relevant and potential customers through a previously made email list or with help from different email marketing tools.

Companies often use various methods to build their lists and to make their emails personalized as much as possible. The main goal of email marketing is to promote products or services in a fast and profitable way alongside the many benefits it carries with it.


Why You Should Use Email Marketing
-----------------------------------------
There are many reasons why email marketing is still popular among companies around the world.

According to several statistics, more than 3.7 billion people around the globe still use emails.

Additionally, more than one hundred billion emails are sent on a daily basis.

Approximately 59 percent of marketers say that email marketing brings them the biggest ROI.

Even in the era of social networks, email marketing is still a powerful tool for finding customers. This is because email marketing can establish a more personal relationship between the buyer and the seller.

In addition to the huge number of spam e-mails, you also receive e-mails that are important to you, such as emails from your family or workplace which makes this whole experience more special.

The electronic mail is also a more formal way of communicating with someone compared to social media. This is because of the exclusive nature that email marketing still works.

The best part about it is that it can be made to fit every costumers’ taste and interest. You can improvise with your emails, making them individual and gain more attention and encourage communication.


The progress of email marketing is fascinating, which, according to many, should have dropped drastically with the development of social networks.

Namely, the growth and the gain from email marketing has increased dramatically in the past years. As previously mentioned, email marketing is an inexpensive way of reaching to the wider public, with which you can also use the methods of traditional marketing only in a digital way.

This means that instead of spending money on printing brochures, for example, you can send them electronically.

Emails also have a signature option. That is a feature where you can put all of your personal information, as well as social media accounts. It’s a good way of introducing yourself in front of your customers.

Unlike social networks, where through statuses you are referring to the whole audience, email marketing enables the differentiation of your customers. Many companies use software that allows them to find the interests of their users and to send more unique and personalized emails.

The personalization is a key element in all types of marketing. People feel like their interests and needs are taken seriously when companies use personalization in their marketing strategies.

Overall, if you want an inexpensive yet effective way of promoting your service or product, email marketing is one of the best ways to do it. But don’t think that doing this is easy and that all you have to do is sent a few emails.

The process is much more complex, and you will need to put a large amount of effort and time into it.

Let’s start from the beginning.


Developing an Email Marketing Strategy
-----------------------------------------

As with everything else in business and marketing, the first thing you need to do is come up with a proper strategy by planning all your steps. Each type of marketing has its own unique aspects, and so does email marketing.

So, there are some things that you might be familiar with, and others that you haven’t paid attention to previously.

So, what are the key things that you need to consider when you are working on an email marketing strategy?

Let’s see.


Setting Goals
------------------

Any marketing strategy requires setting goals. You must know why you are starting the strategy and what you want to achieve with it.

By setting clear goals you will know where to start and what to do exactly.

Whether you are trying to expand your business, get new customers, keep the old ones, or segmentation of your subscribers, clearly established goals will help you achieve success.


Find out How Customers Feel About Your Product
-----------------------------------------------------
Your customers are everything, and without the proper approach, they might see your email marketing attempts as huge spam in their mailbox. This could potentially lead to losing customers.

So, you need to know exactly what the like or dislike and know how they feel about your product.

People are always happy to share their opinion and tell you what they think. When you ask someone for their opinion, you give a person an opportunity to feel important.

Examining opinions and preferences can be done through a section of your website that you will embed yourself, through target groups, a simple conversation or polls.


This is a great way to find out how customers feel about your products. Plus, leaving reviews and opinions about your products will encourage other buyers to buy your product or services.

Unlike the opinions that your customers can give you through these means of ‘communication’ and for which we can not really claim to be true, an estimate based on customer’s previous behavior may be a more reliable indicator of their future behavior.

You can make a good assessment of customer behavior based on how quickly a particular person has had some kind of action on your site. The person who bought something from you most recently has the biggest chances of buying something again.

You can also target the desired group through the frequency of actions your costumers take. The more often someone visits your site and is active, the higher the chances the email marketing will succeed exactly for that person.

Once you engage in researching your customers, their habits and preferences, you will realize how important it is to have insight into the way they spend.

It is logical that those who spend more will be a lighter target than those who spend less. Therefore, it is very important to know who your biggest consumers are.


Build An Email List
-----------------------

This could be the most challenging part even if you are an experienced marketer. Considering that there is a lot there is to know about building an email list, we will be dedicating a whole segment in the article below.

For now, it’s important to know that much on what you do afterward depends on how good you built your email list. There are a lot of things that could go wrong if you are not careful enough.

Each email in your list should be authentic in order for your email marketing strategy and later campaign to turn out successful. Otherwise, you will have a large bounce rate, which can seriously damage your campaign, but we will get to that later as well.

Now let’s focus on another important and final thing in your email strategy.


Decide on the Campaign Type
------------------------------
Depending on what your goal is, you can choose from a wide array of email marketing campaign types.

For now, let’s just say that the email campaign is the end product of your email marketing efforts and the part where you actually do the work that you are planning in your strategy.

Now, let’s briefly go over the types of campaigns that you are able to choose from, and then we will dive deeper into the whole concept of what email marketing campaign is, and how you establish it.


Newsletter
---------------------
I suppose you know exactly what newsletters are. You might have one in your mailbox right now. And yes, they are also considered to be a type of email campaign. But only if you know how to use them to your benefit.

One of the main things that distinguish an email newsletter from the other types we mention here is the fact that you need to decide how often you are going to send it, and this consistency will make you look good in the eyes of the recipient.

Also, you need to keep it simple, preferably on topic. For example, news about your company, or your newest blog posts. I personally, as a Medium Publication user, utilize the benefits of Publication Letters, a feature on Medium that is similar to what we are talking about here.

Basically, I send a weekly newsletter to all of my followers with the content I’ve posted during the previous week. It brings more views to my website, it’s free, and it provides a sense of familiarity and connection between me and my followers.

Announcement
-------------------
When you have a new product, new feature, or service, price discount, maybe you’ve made some changes, or want to share something with your customers, you use the Announcement type of email marketing campaign.

Announcements are perfect to keep your customers and potential customers engaged with the product or service you are offering on the market. It keeps them up-to-date on everything that is happening in your company. Therefore, it creates a more meaningful connection and enhanced trust between you and the email recipient.

Marketing Offer
---------------------
Do you have something new on the table that you want to offer to your customers? Than email marketing is a valuable asset through which you can increase sales by “simply” sending an email.

Of course, is not as easy as that. There are many things you need to think through. However, once you’ve established the type you are going to use in your campaign, it gets slightly easier from there.

Invitation
------------------
Usually, it’s an event invitation. Marketers and business owners use it to increase awareness to an event they are planning and as a chance to increase the attendance by inviting, or sometimes (as a follow-up email) to remind their contacts of the event.

Email Marketing and your campaign are not limited to this only. At the end of the day, it’s up to you what you decide to send to the contacts on your email list. However, these are the most common marketing types that you can use, and they are by far the most effective.



What Is An Email Marketing Campaign?
----------------------------------------------

There are many reasons why you would go for an email marketing campaign, and usually, it comes as a part of your already ongoing inbound marketing campaign.

Needless to say, it has its own benefits, most of which we mentioned above in the article.

Now that you know what email campaign stands for, let’s see what you need to create one.

Create The Best Email Marketing Campaign


The growth of your business depends on it.

Despite being one of the cheaper and more effective marketing options, running an email campaign still needs to be done properly.

Otherwise, you are running the risk of losing your current and potential customers.

After all, no one likes spammers and you can easily turn your campaign in that direction. So the key is to know what you are doing.

To avoid everything from going horribly wrong, you will need to keep an eye on a few crucial things. Luckily for you, we are going to help you determine which approach is positive when you are running an email campaign, and which things you should be paying most attention to.


Personalization
-----------------------
Email marketing brings us the benefits of personalization. In other words, it makes the client and the potential client feel special. Unlike other marketing strategies, email marketing allows you to do this by sending a simplistic message.

Therefore, one of the most important things in the email marketing strategy is the personalization of the sent emails, with which you can build a personal relationship with the person on the other side of the screen.

Among the most common examples of personalization in email marketing is the genius way that the world’s e-commerce giant Amazon is doing. Amazon personalizes its e-mails based on the previous behavior of its consumers.

To be able to customize messages similar to the Amazon, you need to analyze all the behaviors on your side, clicks, and interests of your customers. You can use a variety of analytical tools like Google Analytics that can give you insights into consumer behavior.


Amazon’s messages are not at all intrusive and include the consumer’s name at the very start. The genius thing in their personalized email messages is that they offer consumers products before they even search for them, based on their previous behavior on the page.

Consistency
When you are creating the perfect email marketing strategy, make sure you don’t leave out one of the most important things related to this — consistency.

It’s important to have a clear vision about the design and content of the emails, time of sending the email, the email flow, and so on. It creates trust between you and the targeted customer.

However, this does not mean that you shouldn’t change anything. On the contrary, practice small yet valuable changes every once in a while, like changing something in the design, or in the content of your emails.

Relevant Emails
---------------------
This goes without saying, but you need to send relevant emails to the contacts in your email list. Everything that is not relevant can harm your business. Basically, you need to keep it straight to the point, otherwise, you won't get the wanted reaction.

The relevant content of your emails makes it more likely for the readers to respond to whatever is that you sent to them in your email campaign.

If you want a product boost or brand recognition, with keeping the content simple and on point, users will become more interested in it.


However, the main body of your email is not the only thing you should keep an eye on. You also need to know how to address the emails you sent.

For example, it would be best to start by adding the contact’s name in the subject line, so keep your email template customizable. It’s also, as we mentioned before, a nice way to make your email personalized, a feature that would keep the attention of the readers and maximize their engagement.

Visuals and Images
Do you know that you can boost your engagement by using visuals and images in your emails?

I’ve said this on many occasions, but people are drawn to visual things. Things that are eye appealing. By implementing this into your emails, you will leave the impression of a more serious business owner and raise brand awareness.

However, make sure that you don’t over exaggerate, as you can easily cross the border of what is considered to be ‘too much’.

Keep it simple, but interesting.


Proper Segmentation & Engagement
-----------------------------------
Keep in mind the time you start your email campaign. Most of your targeted audience should open the email, and this will only be done if your email is sent at the appropriate time.

Make a good segmentation of your subscribers according to the time zone they are in. If you want a good response to your email campaign, a higher read rate of your emails, and an increased number of clicks on links, you need to make a good calculation of the time when your customers would open and read the e-mails.

If you are not sure about the time, then you can make a trial period and send several emails in different parts of the day. Through this, you can understand when you get the highest response.

It seems that your clientele segmentation is a key part of your email campaign.

There are several rules among markets when it comes to subscriber engagement and segmentation. Although targeting a particular group means that this group has similar features that will contribute to the growth of your business, they are not the same individual.

When targeting a particular group, keep in mind that each of the clients has their own thoughts and feelings about your company. You should not treat your subscribers as a homogeneous group if you want a greater response to your email campaign.

For this purpose, many marketers use the demographic data of their subscribers. Even though such data may be in favor of your company, it is not always an accurate indicator of your client’s future behavior.


Email Marketing Online Services
--------------------------------------
Although it might appear easy at first glance, you will need as much help as you can get to run a successful email campaign. So don’t be afraid to use some online tools to help you get there.

In order to successfully implement your email marketing strategy and start sending emails, you will need a little help from something called an email service.

Email services are great for tracking your subscriber’s list. They additionally facilitate the process of joining or excluding contacts from your list.

You will also have accurate data on the success of your email campaign. That means you will know the exact number of opened e-mails.

These email services will keep your email message away from the spam mailbox. The timezone for which we have previously discussed will be saved through the scheduling option as well.

Once you finally decide on such a service, the next thing you need to do is to select a good email marketing service. One that will help you with the email campaign.

Apart from the fact that many choose to run their email campaigns personally, these services offer you a number of options that ordinary email services like Gmail or Yahoo do not have.

In ordinary email services, you must manually write all the emails. However, email services designed for email campaigns offer different templates that will not waste your time for creating each email by yourself.

The best of all is that you can send the same messages to Gmail, Yahoo!, Hotmail or any other email service. Also, they allow you to design your emails by changing the color, font and selecting a style that will fit your business.

Some of these services are free, but some are paid. Depending on the package you choose, you receive different options.


GMass
----------

GMass is an email service that offers multiple options like scheduling your emails.

This is a welcomed option for anyone that is making an email campaign in countries with different time zone.

Also, this email service offers open tracking.

That is an option that will tell you if someone has opened your email, clicked any link etc. You can enable the option for automatic follow-ups or write your follow-us manually, as well.

Another email service that you can use is Right Inbox.

Right inbox offers email scheduling, email reminders that can alert you to send follow-ups, private email notes, something that you can use as a personal note when sending another email.

You can use the free version that has its limitation or use the monthly or yearly plan without any limitations.


Reply Up
-----------------

The next email service I believe is worth mentioning is Reply Up.

Reply up has a basic plan that is free, starter plan that costs $8 per year and unlimited plan that is $12 billed annually.

Depending on the plan you get different options. Besides the options for automatic follow-ups, email tracking, templates, response tracking this email service offers personalized emails. Also if you choose the unlimited plan you will be able to send mass emails, an option that cannot be provided by the traditional email services.


ConvertKit
----------------

ConvertKit an email marking software that allows you to send emails on a proper and relevant public. These email marketing tools contain options for growing your audience by sending the right mail to the right person. You can even track your growth, which makes this whole experience smoother and more enjoyable. But we’ll get to that later.

You should consider using an email service for a more successful email campaign. By using such services, you meet the main features of email marketing. These services are cost-effective, you can customize the emails in many ways in order to strengthen your relationship with your customers, they save your time, the results are easily measured and provide a call to action.


Progress Tracking
------------------------

Using this kind of email marketing tools can also help you track the progress of your email campaign, who opened your emails, how many people clicked on your links and even schedule your emails in different time zones.

As you already noticed, these things are included in the tools I listed above.

Of course, you can make your own research and one that fits your needs the most. I decided to give you some suggestions in order to appoint you in which direction you should be looking for. The final decision is up to you.

Now let's get back to something we previously discussed and is one of the crucial things in your email campaign.


How to Build Your Email List?
-----------------------------------

Building an email list is a crucial part of email marketing.

Considering that it’s a vital part of your marketing strategy and email campaign, we decided to pay more attention to this part and explain it in details for your easier implementation.

First and foremost, anyone who runs an email campaign must have а list of a relevant audience where they can offer their product or services. In the absence of time or skills, many people buy email lists.

While purchasing an email list can be tempting, you need a specifically built list that will target the audience that will be most affected by your products or services.

When building your email list, you must keep in mind that you are making connections similar to real life. Gathering email addresses from everywhere an everyone doesn’t mean that your email campaign will bring you success. You should choose your potential clients the same way you choose your real life friends.

Building an email list is a process, but it can be achieved by following a few steps.


Choose Your Potential Clients
--------------------------------

Before starting to build the email list, you must know which group of people you will target. An inadequate audience will not be affected by your product. Hence, your email marketing campaign will be unsuccessful.

Choose to whom you will advertise your product. How old should your potential costumers be, their gender, place of residence, interests, etc.

For example, if you are trying to sell scheduling software that can be connected to different social networks, then you will have a broad field of potential buyers.

You can target different influenсuers that are active on social networks and whose email addresses can be found on their web pages or even media that use these tools to schedule their daily news.

Whichever your product is, you need to carefully choose your clients in order to have a successful email campaign.


Make Your Email List Easy to Join
-------------------------------------

To quickly build an email list, you must provide your customers with an easy way to join.

No one wants to read long and difficult descriptions.

So, it’s best for you to ask your costumers or website visitors only for a name and email.

An excellent strategy for joining an email list is also to ask the buyer to join as soon as a certain product is purchased. Your customers are more likely to register to your email list after purchasing a certain product because they will probably want to follow your promotions and deals further.

An extra tip that may be contrary to what has been said earlier about the ease of joining. Sometimes people may unintentionally misspell their email address. Put another field where they can confirm their email address before they join your email list.


Make an Offer
---------------------

Many e-commerce sites offer a variety of discounts at the very beginning of opening their website if you subscribe to their email list. This strategy can help you increase sales.

However, it can also build a relevant email list of reliable clients who will follow all your offers and promotions that you will be sending them in their inbox.

Check If the Email Addresses Are Valid

Before you start sending emails, make sure that the email addresses are valid. You can check the validity of the email addresses by using some of the free online tools. One of those tools is “Email Hippo”.

Here, you can just put an email address and check its provider and trust score. Later, you can export the data into an Excel or PDF file just in case you want it organized info file.

Avoid collecting email addresses that are too generic and do not contain at least one personal information about the email recipient. Email addresses like webmaster@gen.cam.ac.uk are less likely to have any response.

Define the Sources from Which You Will Collect Email Addresses
Defining the sources is just as important as choosing the clients to whom you want to offer your product.

Ask yourself where do you connect with people? It can be on your website, social media, blog or someplace else. When making an email list it is very important to know where to look.

This contributes not only to the extent of your email list but also to the connection with relevant clients.

For example, if you have an art gallery, try to find email addresses from art forums or directly from artists’ web pages.

An extra tip:

People often leave their names and last names in the comments on different websites, blogs or forums. You can use email tools for finding email addresses using their personal info like name and last name. It may not be the most ethical way of collecting email addresses, but it is a way of carefully choosing your clients.

Second extra tip:

Use Twitter advanced search and type “at dot “, in “All of these words” (this is for people who left their email address in some of the Twitter comments ex. Steve at gmail dot com).

In the “From these accounts” field write the Twitter username and then press search. Twitter will give you all the comments where a particular person has left his/her email address.

Always Tell Your Costumers What You Are Sending
Always tell your potential customers what are you are sending them. Whether it will be monthly releases, weekly coupons, discounts, articles or something else.

Your email list will be much easier to fill if people know what they are applying for. You can post a link with reviews from your already existing clients as a creditor for your goods or services.


Use Social Media
-----------------------

Fortunately, your website is not the only place where you can request email addresses.

You can do the same through the social networks on which you are active.

For this, you will need little knowledge of the HTML field.

However, the process is no different from linking your website with your email. Social media is a treasure trove of a huge number of people who are constantly active on their profiles.

Through the fan pages, it is quite easy to spread your business and get to know it with a huge number of people. So, that’s why this opportunity is great for expanding your email list.


Take the Old-Fashioned Way
------------------------------
To build a quality email list, you can simply ask your customers if they would join your email list. Also, the various events you participate, can be a great opportunity to create new connections and get new email addresses.

Although the business cards are out of fashion, some of the businesses still use them. If you have the privilege of receiving someone’s email card, you have a chance to ask for an email address if it is not listed on the business card. Immediately after the event, you can take the opportunity to send an email with gratitude and create a potential client or a partner.

Pay Attention to Your Email
In creating a quality email list, it’s also important how much data you will provide about yourself in order for your email address to look relevant.

Of course, you do not have to reveal all your personal information but name, surname, workplace and business phone number would be sufficient for your email address to look pertinent. You can also add your social media accounts to your email signature if you think it’s necessary.


What is Email Bounce Rate?
---------------------------------
When starting an email campaign your main goal, besides selling something is actually reaching the desired mailbox.

As previously said, email marketing is an inexpensive way that will get you closer to your customers.

Additionally, it is also a tool for building a reputation.

No matter if your email marketing strategy is well thought out, you will not have any benefit if the message does not reach the recipient’s mailbox.


What happens if the message does not reach the mailbox? And can several unsent messages have a bad influence on your business?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Email messages that did not reach the email address you sent you’re the message are called email bounce.

The percentage of sent emails that did not reach the receiver’s inbox is called email bounce rate.

The sent email may not reach the recipient inbox for many reasons. Some of them are fake email addresses, inactive users or email addresses that contain errors. This is why a well-chosen email list should be your biggest preoccupation.

Nevertheless, traditional email services like Gmail or Yahoo look to protect their users and may block you if they recognize too many emails that haven’t reach someone’s inbox. This will result in an unsuccessful email campaign even with active email addresses because email services recognize a high rate of email bounce.


Soft and Hard Bounces
---------------------------------
There are two types of email bounce soft email bounce and hard email bounce. Soft bounce appears for many reasons like the inbox of the recipient is full, the email you are trying to send is too large, or the receiver’s email server is offline.

Email marketing services often give reports about the reason why the emails you sent did not arrive in the wanted inbox. And some of them allow several soft bounces before starting to consider them as hard bounces. Soft bounces are most often treated as temporary problems with email addresses.

Hard bounces, on the other hand, are considered a permanent reason why email addresses do not work. Hard bounces mostly appear when the email address doesn’t exist. Other reasons are when the server that your receiver is using has blocked you or the domain doesn’t exist.


How to Deal with Email Bounces?
------------------------------------
One way to deal with this problem is to stop it before it appears. In the emails that you send to your users, you can ask them to confirm the email address or provide you with a new one if they are intending to no longer use the old email address.

Also, you must pay attention to your content because the email services can block you if your emails look suspicious and mark it as a spam. That way, your email won’t get open and the email bounce rate will go higher. Again, the low rate of email bounce proves the importance of creating your own email list.

How many times have you received an auto-reply from the same email account? Too often? Then it’s time to remove that contact from your email list. Namely, automatic answers can be the reason for the high rate of email bounce. If your email list is full of subscribers who are inactive then it’s time to clear the list.

The campaign should be effective and reach as many users as possible, but this will not be the case if most of the emails are inactive.


Email Verification Services
--------------------------------------
One way to resolve this issue is to use email verification services. I mentioned the verification more than once earlier in the guide. Email verification is needed in email marketing campaigns in order for your emails to reach the relevant public, and to reach the lowest email bounce rate possible.

The consequences of unverified email addresses and high bounce rate are bad responses, marking your emails as spam, and blocked emails by email addresses that are relevant and true.

The easiest way to check the verification of the email addresses is through email verification services.

The process of checking the verification is quite easy and only consists of copy-pasting the email address.

Some email services come as google extensions and you can check if the email address is active through your Gmail account. You can also use online verification services that offer free checking for at least ten email addresses.


Never Bounce
------------------------

Never Bounce is an email verification service that allows verification of 1.000 email addresses each month for free.

When you pass the limitation you need to pay $0.008 for every additional email address. In its offer Never Bounce includes verification checking of one email address or a list that consists of a larger number of email addresses.

If you decide to use this service you will get mail server validation, domain health check, DNS and MX Validation, Syntax Checks.


InkThemes Email Verification
-----------------------------------

Another email service you can use that has similar features as the one mentioned before is InkThemes Email Verification.

According to their website, InkThemes offers 98% accuracy on removing emails with bad syntax.

InkThemes can check the email service connection which will prevent the hard email bounce, and remove the duplicate and disposable emails from your list. The pricing for 100.000 emails is $159.


MailGet List Cleaning
---------------------------

MailGet List Cleaning is another email verification email service that is highly rated by users. Namely, this service will provide you with some of the best features needed for a successful email campaign and clean email list.

MailGet List Cleaning will delete all high-risk email addresses like disposable emails, emails connected to scams, practically everything that may have negative consequences on your email marketing campaign.

No matter which email service you will choose, verification of email addresses is crucial for spreading your business through email marketing. Such services will help you reach the relevant audience and get your emails to the right inbox.


In conclusion, email marketing was and will remain a personal type of marketing. This type of marketing offers many ways through which you can build a relationship with your customers. Besides, it’s a cheap substitute for modern and traditional ways of product and service promotion.

Email marketing is becoming more and more exclusive. Not many people decide to entrust their email addresses, which is why it is a more complicated form of selling, even though almost everyone can use it.

By carefully collecting email addresses and targeting the relevant client group, your email campaign can greatly contribute to the development of your business.

You can use email marketing in many creative ways, and through it, you can reach people across the planet.
